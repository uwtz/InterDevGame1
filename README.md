# InterDevGame1

The premise of this project was based on my experience as a kid playing with these plastic, hand-spun helicopter toys. I was inspired by the game I played for game club, Samara, and its use of horizontal parallax. I wanted to extend that idea by also adding vertical parallax, and having the player explore both axes. I collaged a mix of hand drawn images and photos I took in China. I found the initial colored background images to be too clustered with detail and too distracting, so I made everything but the toy black and white to help organize the composition. This did make the game feel a lot more depressed than intended. For the majority of the time I spent on this project, I was focused on the launching segment of the game, which resulted in me somewhat neglecting what is to happen when the toy is in the air. I ended up drawing some birds to fill the sky as nothing else came to mind. From this project, I have learned both how to use audio in unity and how to use audio in coherence with design. Overall pretty cool vibe.
